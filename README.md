Learndot API wrapper
===============

This is a simple wrapper for the Learndot API. It's not very complete since it
was built primary to support our own specific needs. If you need an API added,
please file an issue, or contact us and let us know. 

Configuration
===========

The API requires a token. This should be saved in one of two places:

1. `~/.learndot_token`
1. An environment variable of `$LEARNDOT_TOKEN`.

You can get your token at https://{learndot-url}/admin/api/token

Usage 
==========

See the `examples` directory for usage samples.
